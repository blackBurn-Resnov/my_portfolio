    <h1>Portfolio Website</h1>
    <h3><em><strong>Welcome to my Resume! <a href="https://shiva-adith.github.io/my_portfolio/">(Website Link)</a></strong></em></h3>
    <br>
    <p>What I've done, what I'm currently doing, the projects that I have lined up... you can find all of those - and more, in this one ✨<em><strong>Amateur</strong></em>✨ web-page.</p>
    <p>I started out in Web-development during peak lockdown.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This is what my page looked like at first...</p><br>
    <img alt="Stage One" width="75%" src="./evolution/stage_one/home.png">
    <br>
    <h3>Yikes!</h3>
    <p>but then, I improved the design... a <strong>bit</strong></p>
    <img = alt="Stage Two" width="75%" src="./evolution/stage_two/homepage.png">
    <br>
    <p>Pretty neat how a basic level of CSS can make a decent difference huh!</p>
    <br>
    <p>It then took me a couple of weeks of serious research to get to this stage:</p>
    <div>
      <h1 align=center><a href="https://shiva-adith.github.io/my_portfolio/">This is what it looks like now!</a></h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Yup. You have got to visit the site to see the rest :)<p>
    <br>
    <p>Feel free to use the design templates and tinker with it to suit your style!</p>
